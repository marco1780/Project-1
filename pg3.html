			<h1>The Egyptian Pyramids</h1>
			<h2>You are now in the pyramid egyptian
                times. The Egyptian pyramids are
                ancient pyramid-shaped masonry
                structures located in Egypt. They
                were built roughly over 5,000 years
                ago and it remains a mystery as to
                how they were built.
                
                Your purpose here is to try and catch
                a glimpse of how these structures were built.
